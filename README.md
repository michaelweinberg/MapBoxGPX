# MapBoxGPX

App creates a marker and line animation on MapBox's 3d satellite backgrounds.  Implementation of connecting a bluetooth enabled bike trainer is in progress to virtually ride real world terrain.

Program uses the Python Flask library.  Run in local test environment with Python app.py on the command line.

Currently, all the Python portion of the program does is serve up the MapBox token.  In the future it will perform more functions which aren't suited to run in the browser for security.
